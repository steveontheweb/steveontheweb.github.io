Hi!  I'm Steve Middleton, the Creative Services Director at BioWare ULC and I live in Edmonton, Alberta.  I'm mostly into technical art/animation, Unreal Engine, 3D printing, electronics, and backpacking -- so this site is mostly about those things.  

If you're interested in anything here, feel free to reach out and connect.
