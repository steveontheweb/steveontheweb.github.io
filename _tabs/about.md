Hi!  I'm Steve Middleton, the Creative Services Director at BioWare ULC and I live in Edmonton, Alberta.  I'm mostly into **Technical Art & Animation**, **Unreal Engine**, **3D Printing**, **Electronics**, and **Backpacking** -- so this site is mostly about those things. 

If you're interested in anything here, feel free to reach out and connect.
